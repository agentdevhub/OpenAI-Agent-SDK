# Ollama Agent Pattern Examples

This folder contains examples of various common agent patterns implemented using Ollama. These examples demonstrate how to use the agent SDK with Ollama models to build complex applications.

## Running the Examples

Each example can be run directly. For example:

```bash
python routing.py
```

## Available Examples

### routing.py - Routing and Triage

This example demonstrates how to route requests to different specialized agents based on the language of the user's request. A front-line triage agent receives requests and then hands off control to the appropriate language expert agent.

### deterministic.py - Deterministic Workflow

This example demonstrates how to create a deterministic multi-step workflow where each step is performed by a different agent. In this example, we have an agent generating a story outline, an agent checking the quality of the outline, and an agent writing a story based on the outline.

### parallel.py - Parallel Execution

This example demonstrates how to run multiple agent instances in parallel and then select the best result. This is useful for generating multiple alternatives or implementing some form of self-critique.

### agents_as_tools.py - Agents as Tools

This example demonstrates how to use agents as tools rather than via handoff. This allows an orchestrator agent to call other agents in a specific order and maintain control of the conversation.

### llm_as_judge.py - LLM as Judge

This example demonstrates how to use one LLM as a judge to evaluate content generated by another LLM. The first agent generates a story outline, and the second agent evaluates it and provides feedback until quality standards are met.

### input_guardrails.py - Input Guardrails

This example demonstrates how to use guardrails to ensure user input meets specific criteria. In this case, the guardrail is triggered when the user tries to ask for help with math homework.

### output_guardrails.py - Output Guardrails

This example demonstrates how to apply safety checks to model output, ensuring it doesn't contain sensitive information like phone numbers.

### forcing_tool_use.py - Forcing Tool Use

This example demonstrates how to configure an agent to force the use of tools and how to customize behavior after tool use. There are three modes to try: default mode, first tool result mode, and custom logic mode.
